Dear Professor,

I found few bugs in my Knock-Knock program which I attempted to fix and made the program run succesfully. Please find the following error and how i fixed it:

1.When getting users response for how many jokes to tell, my old program accepts negative number of jokes (i.e., -1) and keeps running without printing that the response should be within the range.
While validating the users response I missed to add a condition in if statement that it should not accept a negative number.So, i fixed it by adding a condition like below:

#Validating users response for number of jokes
if totaljokes>len(jokelist) or totaljokes<=0:
    print(f"The number must be in the range: 1 to {len(jokelist)}")
    totaljokes=int(input("\nHow many jokes you want me to tell? "))

2.While giving a wrong response.For example, when it says quiche and i give response as quiche it says "The correct response is quiche who?" only for the first time and doesn't correct for the second time if given a wrong response.

The following is my old program:

  #Running through while to check for the response variants from the user
    while True:
        print(prompt)
        response= input()
  #Checking for response variant with case sensitive and punctuation agnostic
        if response.strip("?!""'',-.").lower() in responses:
            break
        else:
            #Suggesting right response if the response variant is not matched
            print(f"The Correct response is {suggest}\nTry Again")
            print(prompt)
            response= input()
            break

Here, I am getting the response  from the user inside the else part which stops validating the second response from the user beacause it won't check the if condition above. So I removed the three statements inside the else part and fixed the error.
The following is the new program:

  #Running through while to check for the response variants from the user
    while True:
        print(prompt)
        response= input()
  #Checking for response variant with case sensitive and punctuation agnostic
        if response.strip("?!""'',-.").lower() in responses:
            break
        else:
            #Suggesting right response if the response variant is not matched
            print(f"The Correct response is {suggest}\nTry Again")

Now the above program validates the response each time with the if condition.

3.If i give a wrong response which is not in the list of responses, it says "The correct response is.." 
But if the wrong response is already a part of the list it does not correct you and proceeds giving the joke.

For example,
knock knock 
who's there
quiche
leon who (which is in the list)
Can I have a hug and a quiche? 

Here I am supposed to give Quiche who. But the program ran for a wrong response which is in the list)

In my old program i had a seperate list for jokes which has all the other jokes and responses which i now removed it and made sure to validate only the joke which was prompted during the user interaction.
The following is the change i made to the parameters while calling the function:

for x in  (jokelist[:totaljokes]):
    #using the function prompt response for responses 
    promptresponse('\nKnock-Knock',resp_list1,"'who's there?'\n")
    promptresponse(f'{x[0]}',[f'{x[0]} who?'.strip("?!""'',-.").lower()],f"'{x[0]} who?'\n")
    print(f"{x[1]}\n{'-'*40}")
print("\nThank you Play Again")
